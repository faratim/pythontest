# Exercise 1.2

In this exercise, I learned about several different data structures and types including: scalar objects, non-scalar objects, tuples, lists, strings, dictionaries

### recipe_1

For the first recipe in the recipe app, I chose a dictionary as the data type because it allows for key:value pairs that will keep the data organized and consistent across recipes. Ensuring each recipe has the same keys will ensure continuity in the data.

### all_recipes

For the all_recipes structure, I chose a list because it is mutable and ordered.
